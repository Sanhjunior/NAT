Dessign diferences:
-------------------

Since IE lacks of suport of border-radius and box-shadow in ie8+, and since for requirements of the test I can't use any extra script or plugin, I used images for the ellipsis in the Carusel and for the interior shadow in the email input, for instance of pure CSS.

I couldn't find a reason why in the navigation Bar the active element (news & features), in ie doesn't has the extra high in ie8.

I could't find a way to stylice the checkboxes on ie8+, since it lacks of support of the pseudo element :checked, so I left the default ones, although I bet that with some more time I could find a way through jquery.
